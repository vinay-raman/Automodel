## Environment setup for Automodel

Common workflows used for setting up Automodel environment:

1. [Developing with Automodel container](#1-developing-with-automodel-container)
2. [Developing with UV sync/pip install](#2-developing-with-uv-syncpip-install)
3. [Developing with custom docker build](#3-developing-with-custom-docker-build)

### 1. Developing with Automodel container

The latest Automodel container can be found: [here](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/nemo-automodel)

The container can be run with the following docker command:

```bash
docker run --gpus all --network=host -it --rm --shm-size=32g nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo-automodel:26.06.00 /bin/bash
```

#### Mounting local Automodel directory into the container

To sync local Automodel directory into the container, mount the local directory into `/opt/Automodel` and override the installed Automodel repository.
Example docker command:

```bash
docker run --gpus all --network=host -it --rm -v <local-Automodel-path>:/opt/Automodel --shm-size=32g nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo-automodel:26.06.00 /bin/bash
```

Within the container, cd into `/opt/Automodel/` and update the pyproject.toml and uv.lock file by running the following command:

```bash
bash docker/common/update_pyproject_pytorch.sh /opt/Automodel
```

Finally, run uv sync to sync the container with the updated repository:

```bash
uv sync --locked --extra all --all-groups
```

> [!WARNING]
> Ensure `bash docker/common/update_pyproject_pytorch.sh /opt/Automodel` is executed. Without this command, uv sync will attempt to reinstall `torch`. This leads to errors relating to CUDA version mismatch, TE import failures, etc. This work around is required as uv cannot recognize the torch installed in the PyTorch base container.

### 2. Developing with uv sync/pip install

Uv sync and pip install are both supported in Automodel. Uv sync is the recommened path.

From the local Automodel directory run the following command:

```bash
uv sync --locked --extra all
```

The following optional dependencies are available, please see `[project.optional-dependencies]` section in [pyproject.toml](./pyproject.toml):

- cuda (all dependencies that require cuda)
- extra (additional dependencies for model coverage)
- fa (flash attention)
- delta-databricks
- moe
- vlm
- all (installs cuda, delta-databricks, extra and vlm)

Example, installing vlm dependencies:

```bash
uv sync --locked --extra vlm
```

### 3. Developing with custom docker build

For developers building a custom docker container with Automodel, please refer to Automodel's [Dockerfile](./docker/Dockerfile).

If [Nvidia PyTorch](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/pytorch-release-notes/index.html) container is used as a base image, please review [Developing with Automodel container](#1-developing-with-automodel-container).

Command to build Automodel's Dockerfile:

```bash
# Set build arguments
export AUTOMODEL_INSTALL=all #(cuda, moe, vlm, ...)
export BASE_IMAGE=pytorch #(cuda, pytorch)

# Dependency install options [True, False]
export INSTALL_TE=True

docker build -f docker/Dockerfile \
    --build-arg AUTOMODEL_INSTALL=$AUTOMODEL_INSTALL \
    --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=$BASE_IMAGE \
    --build-arg INSTALL_MAMBA=$INSTALL_MAMBA \
    -t automodel --target=automodel_final .
```

## MoE Dependency

* Requires [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&Distribution=Ubuntu&target_version=20.04&target_type=deb_network)

```bash
wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2004/x86_64/cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cudnn-cuda-12
pip install transformer-engine[pytorch]==2.8.0
# Flash-attn version should be selected to satisfy TE requirements
# https://github.com/NVIDIA/TransformerEngine/blob/v2.4/transformer_engine/pytorch/attention/dot_product_attention/utils.py#L108
pip install flash-attn==2.7.4.post1
pip install grouped_gemm
```

## Development Dependencies

We use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for managing dependencies.

New required dependencies can be added by `uv add $DEPENDENCY`. If
`pyproject.toml` changes, update both lock files using the same flow as
[Generate Uv lock](./.github/workflows/uv-lock-generation.yml). This updates
the default `uv.lock`, then updates the PyTorch-container lock file with the
override dependencies from `docker/common/uv-pytorch.toml`. The PyTorch helper
rewrites `pyproject.toml` for locking, so the commands below save and restore
your intended `pyproject.toml` contents:

The workflow can update lock files automatically for same-repository PRs. For
PRs opened from forks, the workflow runs in check-only mode because it cannot
push fixes back to the fork. If the fork check fails, run this lock update flow
locally and include the generated lock files in your branch.

```bash
set -e

uv lock --check || uv lock

tmp_pyproject="$(mktemp)"
cp pyproject.toml "$tmp_pyproject"
mv uv.lock uv_main.lock
bash docker/common/update_pyproject_pytorch.sh "$PWD"
uv lock --check || uv lock
mv uv.lock docker/common/uv-pytorch.lock
mv uv_main.lock uv.lock
cp "$tmp_pyproject" pyproject.toml
rm "$tmp_pyproject"
```

Only commit your intended `pyproject.toml` changes plus the generated lock
files:

```bash
git add pyproject.toml uv.lock docker/common/uv-pytorch.lock
git commit -s -m "build: Adding dependencies"
git push
```

## Linting and Formatting

We use [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting.

Installation:

```bash
pip install ruff
```

Format:

```bash
ruff check --fix .
ruff format .
```

## Pre-commit

We recommand to use [prek](https://github.com/j178/prek) to ensure code quality. It is a faster and more modern alternative to [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit).

Installation:

```bash
uv tool install prek
```

Usage:

```bash
# Install git hooks
prek install

# Run manually on all files
prek run --all-files
```

After installing the git hooks, `git commit` will automatically run incremental checks.

## Adding Documentation

If your contribution involves documentation changes, please refer to the [Documentation Development](docs/documentation.md) guide for detailed instructions on building and serving the documentation.

## Signing Your Work

* We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

  * Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

* To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:

  ```bash
  git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```

  This will append the following to your commit message:

  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```
