"""Backend-agnostic correctness check for the cp=1 prefix-tree mask.

Realizes the folded :class:`AttnMaskSpec` as a ``flex_attention`` mask (pure
torch, runs on Ampere/A100 and Hopper alike, no magi/FA4 build) and compares its
output, position by position, against an independently constructed dense-mask
SDPA reference. The reference is built straight from the rollout structure (each
completion attends FULL to the prompt and CAUSAL to itself), NOT from the spec,
so a wrong spec or a wrong realization of it is caught.

This validates the part we added (fold rollouts -> AttnMaskSpec, realize the
mask); the magi FFA kernel that consumes the same spec on Hopper is checked
separately by ``prefix_tree_magi_parity.py``. Run with::

    python tests/functional_tests/attention/prefix_tree_flex_parity.py

Exit code 0 means parity holds.
