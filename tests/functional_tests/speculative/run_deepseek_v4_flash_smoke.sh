# DeepSeek-V4-Flash DSpark end-to-end smoke test (REAL recipe path, 8 GPUs).
#
# Validates: distributed V4 target load (expert-parallel + FSDP2, FP8/FP4 dequant)
#   -> online hidden-state capture across the EP shards -> draft training
#   -> finite, decreasing three-term loss. This is the path the full config
#   (deepseek_v4_flash_dspark.yaml) takes, but with the target shrunk to 4 layers
#   (target_num_hidden_layers=4) so it fits on ONE 8x80GB node and reaches a step
#   in minutes. The full 43-layer target needs >=2 nodes (see the full config).
#
# PREREQUISITES (the smoke cannot pass without these):
#   * DeepEP (or HybridEP) installed in the env -- the V4 MoE token dispatcher
#     requires it; without it setup() raises "HybridEP is not installed".
#   * 8 GPUs, >=80 GiB each. The smoke loads only 4 target layers (~a few GiB/rank
#     of experts at ep_size=8); the full target would OOM here, hence the reduction.
#   * A local DeepSeek-V4-Flash checkpoint.
