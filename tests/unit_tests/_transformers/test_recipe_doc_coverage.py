"""Recipe-level doc-coverage check.

Scans every example YAML under ``examples/``, extracts the HF model IDs from
``pretrained_model_name_or_path`` fields, resolves each ID to an architecture
via ``AutoConfig.from_pretrained`` (config.json only — no GPU allocation, no
weight download), then asserts every resolved architecture is mentioned in at
least one ``docs/model-coverage/*.mdx`` file.

This complements ``test_doc_coverage.py`` which only covers archs registered
in ``MODEL_ARCH_MAPPING``. Many recipes fine-tune HF-native archs (e.g.,
``Olmo2ForCausalLM``) that never get added to the registry, and still need
documentation.

Offline / CI behavior
---------------------
Arch resolution hits the Hugging Face hub for ``config.json`` (a few KB per
model — no weights, no GPU allocation). CI workers run with the hub disabled
(``HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1``) and would otherwise just accumulate lookup errors for
every recipe, so the resolution step is **opt-in**: set
``NEMO_DOC_COVERAGE_RESOLVE_ARCHS=1`` to enable it. Without the env var the
test only sanity-checks the YAML scanner.

Developers can run the full check in two modes:
  * **Online:** ``NEMO_DOC_COVERAGE_RESOLVE_ARCHS=1 pytest …`` — configs are
    fetched from the hub and cached under ``~/.cache/huggingface/hub``.
  * **Offline (with a warm cache):** same env var; ``AutoConfig`` re-uses the
    cached ``config.json`` files, so no network is needed. Per-model cache
    misses are skipped rather than failing the test.
