"""Shared training-loop utilities for the speculative-decoding recipes.

EAGLE-1/2, EAGLE-3, and DFlash all hand-roll the same gradient-accumulation
bookkeeping (ceil optimizer-steps-per-epoch and the DDP ``no_sync`` skip) and the
same warmup + cosine LR schedule. Centralizing them here keeps the recipes from
drifting apart when one is fixed and the others are missed.
