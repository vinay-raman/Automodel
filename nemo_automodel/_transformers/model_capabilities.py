"""Programmatic query API for NeMo AutoModel's per-architecture capability registry.

Two declaration patterns are supported on registered model classes:

1. **Static** -- nested ``ModelCapabilities`` dataclass on the class. Used by
   classes whose capability profile does not depend on config.
2. **Dynamic** -- ``get_capabilities(cls, config)`` classmethod. Used by
   classes that serve multiple checkpoint variants (e.g. ``Gemma4`` MoE vs.
   dense vs. audio).

A class must declare capabilities via exactly one of these patterns.
:func:`query_capabilities` dispatches to whichever is present and always
returns the canonical :class:`ModelCapabilities` defined here.
