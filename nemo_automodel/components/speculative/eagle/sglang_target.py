"""SGLang adapter for the EAGLE-3 target backend.

A thin engine adapter on top of the engine-agnostic contract in
:mod:`nemo_automodel.components.speculative.eagle.target_runner`: it builds a
SGLang runner and wraps it in :class:`RunnerEagle3TargetModel`. SGLang is the
fastest serving path for mainstream architectures, so a remote target server
(:mod:`nemo_automodel.components.speculative.serve_target`) can hold the target
on dedicated GPUs while the draft trains elsewhere.

All supervision-contract logic (shift / aux-concatenation semantics, aux-layer
defaulting, embedding access) lives in ``target_runner`` and is shared with any
future engine adapter (e.g. vLLM). This module owns only SGLang construction,
and the SGLang-internal forward is isolated further in
:mod:`nemo_automodel.components.speculative.eagle.sglang_runner`, imported lazily
by :meth:`SGLangEagle3TargetModel.from_pretrained` so importing this module never
pulls in SGLang.
