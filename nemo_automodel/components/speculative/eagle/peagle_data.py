"""Conditional-On-Distribution (COD) sampling for P-EAGLE parallel drafting.

P-EAGLE (https://github.com/vllm-project/speculators/pull/480) trains all ``K``
draft depths in a *single* parallel forward rather than EAGLE-3's sequential
test-time-training (TTT) unroll. To keep the flattened multi-depth sequence
affordable, COD subsamples deeper depths with geometric decay: depth 0 keeps all
``n`` positions, depth 1 keeps ``n * r``, depth 2 ``n * r**2``, ..., so the
attention cost drops from ``O((nK)**2)`` to ``O((n * sum r**i)**2)``.

This is a verbatim port of speculators' ``generate_cod_sample_indices`` so the
on-disk draft trains against the exact distribution vLLM's parallel-drafting
runtime samples at inference.
