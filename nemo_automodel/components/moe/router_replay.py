"""Rollout Routing Replay (R3) for MoE policy-gradient training.

In on-policy RL on a Mixture-of-Experts model, the rollout (inference) engine and
the training engine compute the router's top-k expert selection independently.
Numerical differences between the two backends flip a small fraction of routing
decisions per layer, which compounds across layers until most tokens are routed to
a different set of experts than they were during rollout. That mismatch breaks the
importance-sampling assumption behind GRPO/GSPO and destabilizes training.

Routing replay removes the mismatch by capturing the top-k expert *selection* during
one forward pass (the rollout-equivalent forward) and replaying that exact selection
during the training forward. Only the discrete selection is replayed: the router
logits and their softmax/sigmoid are still recomputed from the live router weights,
so the gradient continues to flow into the router. This mirrors Megatron-LM's
``moe_enable_routing_replay`` integration.

Usage::

    from nemo_automodel.components.moe.router_replay import RouterReplay

    # Capture the selection on the rollout-equivalent forward.
    with RouterReplay.record():
        model(batch)
    captured = RouterReplay.collect()  # one tensor per MoE layer, in layer order

    # Replay it on the training forward over the same tokens.
    with RouterReplay.replay(captured):
        loss = model(batch)
    loss.backward()

Each :class:`Gate` constructed with routing replay enabled owns one
:class:`RouterReplay` instance and registers it in a process-global list at
construction time. The global order is the construction order, which matches the
layer order, so ``collect()`` and ``replay()`` line the per-layer tensors up by
position. This assumes single-threaded model construction (the norm for recipe
training); call :meth:`RouterReplay.clear_registry` before building a second
model in the same process.
