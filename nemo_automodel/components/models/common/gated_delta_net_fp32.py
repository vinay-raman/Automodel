"""Shared checkpoint helpers for fp32 GatedDeltaNet (GDN) params.

GDN layers carry intrinsically-fp32 bare parameters (``A_log`` and ``dt_bias``)
that feed the decay gate ``g = -exp(A_log) * softplus(a + dt_bias)``. Under FSDP2
mixed precision with fp32 master weights, the bulk of a model computes in bf16
(``param_dtype=bf16``) while these parameters must stay in fp32 -- ``A_log`` is
exponentiated, so bf16 rounding becomes a proportional error on the decay rate
that the recurrence compounds across the sequence.

Each model owns the runtime construction of its fp32 holder. This module only
centralizes the checkpoint contract: hide ``_fp32_params`` in saved HF-compatible
keys, route bare HF keys back into the holder for native load, and upcast these
params to fp32 when checkpoint tensors arrive in a lower precision.
