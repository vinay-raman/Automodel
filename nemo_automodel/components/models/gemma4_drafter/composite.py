"""Composite model for joint fine-tuning of a Gemma 4 base + its drafter.

The composite orchestrates a forward pass that:

1. Runs the base ``Gemma4ForConditionalGeneration`` with
   ``return_shared_kv_states=True`` and ``output_hidden_states=True``.
2. Builds the drafter's ``inputs_embeds`` by concatenating the (already
   ``sqrt(H_b)``-scaled) base token embeddings with the base's final hidden
   state along the feature axis.
3. Runs the drafter ``Gemma4AssistantForCausalLM`` with the captured
   ``shared_kv_states`` and the concatenated embeddings.
4. Returns a :class:`Gemma4JointOutput` that exposes both base logits and a
   per-step list of drafter logits so the training recipe can compute
   ``L = L_base + drafter_loss_weight * sum_k L_drafter_k``.

Both sub-models are trainable. Gradients from the drafter loss flow back into
the base through:
- the "store" KV layers (last non-shared layer of each ``layer_type``) via
  ``shared_kv_states``;
- the base's input embedding (consumed by the drafter's first projection);
- the base's final hidden state.

This is the EAGLE-2 / Medusa-2 style co-training pattern: the drafter stays
aligned with a base that is itself moving.
