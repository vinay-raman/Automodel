    Important implementation notes:

    1. The target alignment should still follow the original EAGLE-3 training
       flow: target logits / input ids are shifted in target preparation, as in
       the reference SpecForge implementation.
    2. We intentionally do *not* preserve the original loss reduction from the
       EAGLE / SpecForge code. The reference implementation averages over
       ``batch * seq_len`` even when only a small subset of positions is valid.
       That reduction is not a sound masked-loss definition because the loss
       scale changes with padding / sparse supervision density. Here we
       normalize by the number of valid supervised positions, which is the
       correct masked objective.

    Args:
        logits: Draft logits of shape ``[batch, seq_len, draft_vocab_size]``.
        target_probs: Target distributions aligned to the draft vocabulary.
        position_mask: Boolean/0-1 mask of shape ``[batch, seq_len, 1]``.

    Returns:
        Scalar loss normalized by the number of valid positions.
