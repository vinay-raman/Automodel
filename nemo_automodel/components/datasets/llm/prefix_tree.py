"""Shared-prefix rollout folding for multi-turn prefix-tree attention (cp=1).

Folds a group of rollouts that share one prompt prefix (one prompt -> N sampled
completions) into a single deduplicated flat token layout plus the prefix-tree
structure (``node_lengths`` / ``sample_paths``). The shared prompt is stored
once; every completion attends FULL to the prompt and CAUSAL to itself.

This is the verl RFC #6401 / Automodel #2385 shared-prefix RL training layout,
restricted to the cp=1 path (no context-parallel dispatch). The collate carries
the structure on the batch; the magi backend builds the ``AttnMaskSpec`` from it
and activates it (the datasets layer must not import ``components.distributed``).
Enable it with ``model.backend.attn: magi``.

Branch-point note: the shared prompt's final position is stored once, so it can
predict only one next token. The N completions diverge there, so the
prompt -> first-completion-token transition is left unsupervised (label
``-100`` on the last prompt token); each completion is supervised causally from
its own first token onward. This is inherent to deduplicating the shared prefix.

    Labels follow this repo's next-token convention: they are pre-shifted (the

    should predict at ``p``. Within each completion, token ``t`` predicts token
    ``t + 1``; the completion's last token has no in-layout successor and is
    masked. The shared prompt is masked entirely, including its last position:
    that position is the branch point where the N completions diverge, so it
    cannot supervise any single first-completion token (the cost of deduplicating
    the prefix is that each completion's first token is unsupervised).
