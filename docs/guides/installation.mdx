## Choose Your Installation Method

Pick the installation method that matches your needs and platform.

### Decision Criteria

| Method | Best For | Pros | Cons |
|--------|----------|------|------|
| **Docker Container** | Production, multi-node, Debian-based systems | Reproducible environment, pre-configured dependencies, GPU driver isolation | Larger download size, container overhead |
| **virtualenv (PyPI/Git)** | Local development, quick prototyping, macOS | Fast setup, lightweight, direct code access | Manual dependency management, platform-specific issues |

### When to Use Docker Containers

Use Docker containers when you need:

- **Multi-node deployments**: Containers ensure consistency across cluster nodes
- **Production environments**: Reproducible builds with tested dependency versions
- **GPU driver compatibility**: Isolates CUDA/driver versions from host system
- **Debian-based systems**: Recommended for Ubuntu, Debian, and derivatives due to dependency complexity
- **Complex dependencies**: Pre-configured environment with all optimizations (TransformerEngine, DeepEP, etc.)
- **Team consistency**: Same environment across development, testing, and production

### When to Use virtualenv

Use virtualenv (PyPI, Git, or editable install) when you need:

- **Local development**: Fast iteration on code changes
- **Quick prototyping**: Minimal setup for experimentation
- **macOS systems**: Better native support without container overhead
- **Frequent code changes**: Contributors working on the codebase (use editable install)
- **Compatible GPU drivers**: System has correct CUDA toolkit and drivers installed
- **Lightweight setup**: Minimal disk space and memory footprint

### Platform-Specific Recommendations

#### Linux (Debian-based: Ubuntu, Debian)

**Recommended: Docker Container**

Debian-based systems can have dependency conflicts with system packages. Containers provide isolation and consistency.

```bash
docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo-automodel:25.11.00
docker run --gpus all -it --rm --shm-size=8g nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo-automodel:25.11.00
```

**Alternative: virtualenv** (if Docker is not available)

Ensure CUDA 11.8+ and compatible drivers are installed:

```bash
# Check CUDA version
nvidia-smi

# Install via PyPI
pip3 install nemo-automodel
```

#### Linux (RHEL, CentOS, Fedora)

**Recommended: Docker Container**

Containers avoid enterprise Linux package management complexity.

Follow the same Docker commands as Debian-based systems above.

#### macOS

**Recommended: virtualenv**

Docker on macOS has GPU limitations. Use native Python installation:

```bash
# Using PyPI
pip3 install nemo-automodel

# Or using uv for reproducible environments
uv pip install nemo-automodel
```

<Note>
GPU training on macOS is not supported. Use macOS for CPU-based experimentation or remote cluster submission.

</Note>

#### Windows

**Recommended: WSL2 + Docker**

Run NeMo AutoModel in WSL2 with Docker Desktop:

1. Install WSL2 and Docker Desktop.
2. Use Docker container within WSL2 (follow Linux instructions).

**Alternative: WSL2 and virtualenv**

Install directly in WSL2 Ubuntu environment (follow Debian instructions).

### Common Issues and Solutions

**GPU driver compatibility errors**
- **Problem**: CUDA version mismatch between host and application
- **Solution**: Use Docker container to isolate driver versions

**Dependency conflicts on Debian/Ubuntu**
- **Problem**: System packages conflict with Python packages
- **Solution**: Use Docker container or create isolated virtualenv with `uv`

**Out of memory during container startup**
- **Problem**: Insufficient shared memory for PyTorch data loading
- **Solution**: Increase `--shm-size` parameter (e.g., `--shm-size=16g`)

**TransformerEngine import failures**
- **Problem**: Incorrect CUDA toolkit or missing dependencies
- **Solution**: Use pre-configured Docker container

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- **Python**: 3.10 or higher
- **CUDA**: 11.8 or higher (for GPU support)
- **Memory**: Minimum 16GB RAM, 32GB+ recommended
- **Storage**: At least 50GB free space for models and datasets

### Hardware Requirements

- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU with 8GB+ VRAM (16GB+ recommended)
- **CPU**: Multi-core processor (8+ cores recommended)
- **Network**: Stable internet connection for downloading models

## Installation Options for Non-Developers
This section explains the easiest installation options for non-developers, including using pip3 via PyPI or leveraging a preconfigured NVIDIA NeMo Docker container. Both methods offer quick access to the latest stable release of NeMo AutoModel with all required dependencies.

### Install via PyPI (Recommended)

For most users, the easiest way to get started is using `pip3`.

```bash
pip3 install nemo-automodel
```
<Tip>
This installs the latest stable release of NeMo AutoModel from PyPI.

To verify the install, run `python -c "import nemo_automodel; print(nemo_automodel.__version__)"`. See [nemo-automodel on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/nemo-automodel/).

</Tip>

### Install with NeMo Docker Container
You can use NeMo AutoModel with the NeMo Docker container. Pull the container by running:
```bash
docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo-automodel:25.11.00
```
<Note>
The above `docker` command uses the [`25.11.00`](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/nemo-automodel?version=25.11.00) container. Use the [most recent container](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/nemo-automodel) version to ensure you get the latest version of AutoModel and its dependencies like PyTorch, Transformers, etc.

</Note>

Then you can enter the container using:
```bash
docker run --gpus all -it --rm \
  --shm-size=8g \
  -v "$(pwd)"/checkpoints:/opt/Automodel/checkpoints \
  nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo-automodel:25.11.00
```

<Info>
**Persist your checkpoints.** By default, checkpoints are written to `checkpoints/` inside the container. Because `--rm` destroys the container on exit, any data stored only inside the container is lost. Always bind-mount a host directory for the checkpoint path (as shown with `-v` above) so that your trained weights survive after the container stops. You can also mount additional directories for datasets and Hugging Face cache:
```bash
docker run --gpus all -it --rm \
  --shm-size=8g \
  -v /path/to/your/checkpoints:/opt/Automodel/checkpoints \
  -v /path/to/your/datasets:/datasets \
  -v /path/to/your/hf_cache:/root/.cache/huggingface \
  nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo-automodel:25.11.00
```

</Info>

<Tip>
**Models that require CUDA-specific packages (e.g., Nemotron).** Some model families—such as Nemotron Nano and Nemotron Flash—depend on packages like `mamba-ssm` and `causal-conv1d` that must be compiled against a matching CUDA toolkit. Installing these from source on a bare-metal host can be error-prone. The NeMo Automodel Docker container ships with these dependencies pre-built, so **using the container is the recommended approach** for fine-tuning Nemotron and other models with similar requirements.

</Tip>

## Installation Options for Developers

This section provides installation options for developers, including pulling the latest source from GitHub, using editable mode, or mounting the repo inside a NeMo Docker container.

### Install from GitHub (Source)

If you want the **latest features** from the `main` branch or want to contribute:

#### Option A – Use `pip` With Git Repo
```bash
pip3 install git+https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Automodel.git
```
<Note>
This installs the repo as a standard Python package (not editable).

</Note>

#### Option B – Use `uv` With Git Repo
```bash
uv pip install git+https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Automodel.git
```
<Note>
`uv` handles virtual environment transparently and enables more reproducible installs.

</Note>

### Install in Developer Mode (Editable Install)

To contribute or modify the code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Automodel.git
cd Automodel
pip3 install -e .
```

<Note>
This installs AutoModel in editable mode, so changes to the code are immediately reflected in Python.

</Note>

### Mount the Repo into a NeMo Docker Container

To run `Automodel` inside a NeMo container while **mounting your local repo**, follow these steps:

```bash
# Step 1: Clone the AutoModel repository.
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Automodel.git
cd Automodel

# Step 2: Pull a compatible container image (replace the tag as needed).
docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo-automodel:25.11.00

# Step 3: Run the container, mount the repo, and run a quick sanity check.
docker run --gpus all -it --rm \
  -v $(pwd):/workspace/Automodel \         # Mount repo into container workspace
  -v $(pwd)/Automodel:/opt/Automodel \     # Optional: Mount Automodel under /opt for flexibility
  --shm-size=8g \                           # Increase shared memory for PyTorch/data loading
  nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo-automodel:25.11.00 /bin/bash -c "\
    cd /workspace/Automodel && \           # Enter the mounted repo
    pip install -e . && \                  # Install Automodel in editable mode
    automodel examples/llm_finetune/llama3_2/llama3_2_1b_squad.yaml" # Run a usage example
```
<Note>
The above `docker` command mounts your local `Automodel` directory into the container at `/workspace/Automodel`.

</Note>

## Install Profiles

NeMo AutoModel provides several install extras for different use cases.

### Full Install (default)

Installs the core library with all LLM training dependencies (PyTorch, CUDA, etc.):

```bash
pip3 install nemo-automodel
```

### CLI-Only Install (Login Nodes)

If you only need to **submit jobs** from a login node or CI environment (SLURM,
SkyPilot, NeMo-Run) and do **not** need to run training locally, use the
lightweight CLI-only install:

```bash
pip3 install nemo-automodel[cli]
```

This installs only `pyyaml` -- no PyTorch, no CUDA. The `automodel` and `am`
CLI commands will be available for SLURM and SkyPilot job submission. If you
also need the NeMo-Run launcher, install it separately (`pip install nemo-run`).
If you accidentally try to run a local/interactive job with this install, you
will get a clear error with instructions to install the full package.

### VLM Dependencies

For vision-language model training, add the VLM extras:

```bash
pip3 install nemo-automodel[vlm]
```

### CUDA-Specific Packages

For models requiring TransformerEngine, bitsandbytes, Mamba, or other
CUDA-compiled packages:

```bash
pip3 install nemo-automodel[cuda]
```

### All Extras

Install everything (CUDA, VLM, NeMo-Run, etc.):

```bash
pip3 install nemo-automodel[all]
```

<Tip>
You can combine extras: `pip3 install nemo-automodel[vlm,cuda]`
