# Fine-Tune DeepSeek V4 Flash

## Introduction

[deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash) is the latest fine-grained Mixture-of-Experts language model from DeepSeek. It uses a 43-layer all-MoE backbone (no dense MLP layers) with 256 routed experts plus one shared expert per block and top-6 routing. The architecture introduces a hybrid per-layer attention zoo — Sliding-Window Attention (SWA), Compressed Sparse Attention (CSA, Compressor + Indexer), and Hierarchical Compressed Attention (HCA, Compressor only) — selectable per layer through `compress_ratios`. The first `num_hash_layers` blocks use a hash-clustering gate (`DeepseekV4HashGate`) for token-to-expert routing, and every block maintains `hc_mult=4` Hyper-Connection streams mixed via a learned col-norm-first Sinkhorn router.

This guide walks you through fine-tuning DeepSeek V4 Flash on HellaSwag using NVIDIA NeMo Automodel. You will learn how to configure the recipe, launch training, and inspect the results.

To set up your environment to run NeMo Automodel, follow the [installation guide](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Automodel#-install-nemo-automodel).

## Data

### HellaSwag

We use [HellaSwag](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Rowan/hellaswag), a commonsense natural-language-inference dataset consisting of context + four candidate continuations. The version used here is the standard `rowan/hellaswag` HuggingFace split, formatted for next-token-prediction fine-tuning.

- **Train / validation splits** taken directly from the HuggingFace dataset.
- **Tokenizer**: shared with the base model (`AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained` on the DeepSeek V4 Flash checkpoint).
- **Padding**: `pad_seq_len_divisible=64` via the default collater.

For the full HellaSwag dataset wrapper used in NeMo Automodel, see [`nemo_automodel.components.datasets.llm.hellaswag.HellaSwag`](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Automodel/blob/main/nemo_automodel/components/datasets/llm/hellaswag.py).

## Architecture Notes

DeepSeek V4 Flash differs from V3 / V3.2 in several load-bearing ways. The state-dict adapter and pipeline-parallel forward in NeMo Automodel handle each of these transparently:

- **Attention**: GQA with a single KV head broadcast to all 64 attention heads, Q-LoRA (`q_lora_rank=1024`), and grouped O-LoRA (`o_lora_rank=1024`, `o_groups=8`) — not MLA. Per-head non-learnable rsqrt on Q after `wq_b` matches the inference reference.
- **Hybrid attention via `compress_ratios`**:
  - `compress_ratio=0` → pure SWA with a learned per-head attention sink.
  - `compress_ratio=4` → CSA: Compressor (overlap mode, pools `2 * ratio` raw tokens per compressed token) plus Indexer (selects top-k compressed positions per query). An explicit additive `[B, 1, S, P_total]` mask enforces per-query causal correctness.
  - `compress_ratio=128` → HCA: Compressor only (non-overlap pooling), deterministic `p < (q + 1) // ratio` causal mask.
- **Dual RoPE bases**: `theta=10000` for `compress_ratio==0` layers; `theta=160000` (with YaRN scaling) for `compress_ratio>0` layers, applied to both the main attention Q/KV and the Compressor sub-module on those layers. RoPE is encoded as INTERLEAVED pairs (`view_as_complex` style) to match the released checkpoint.
- **Hash-routing first layers**: the first `num_hash_layers` (default 3) blocks use a `DeepseekV4HashGate` with a `tid2eid` lookup table. `input_ids` is threaded through the model and the V4-aware pipeline forward; under pipeline parallelism, hash layers live on stage 0 where `input_ids` is available.
- **Hyper-Connections (HC)**: every block maintains `hc_mult=4` streams of the hidden state. The mixer follows the released `hc_split_sinkhorn` formulas: `pre = sigmoid + eps`, `post = 2 * sigmoid` (no `+eps`), `comb = softmax(dim=-1) + eps` followed by a col-norm-first Sinkhorn (`iters - 1` alternating row/col passes), producing a doubly-stochastic mixing matrix per block.
- **MoE routing**: `sqrtsoftplus` scoring with `noaux_tc` topk method and clamped SwiGLU on routed experts (`swiglu_limit=10.0`).
- **Optional MTP layers** via `num_nextn_predict_layers`.

### Checkpoint format

The released DSV4-Flash safetensors mix several quantization formats. The state-dict adapter handles all of them transparently:

- **Routed experts**: FP4 `e2m1fn` packed two values per int8 byte, with per-row 32-col FP8 `e8m0fnu` scales — unpacked on load, re-emitted in matching packed placeholders on `to_hf` so DCP shape/dtype validation lines up with the on-disk layout.
- **Shared experts + non-expert weights**: standard FP8 `e4m3fn` 128×128 block scales.
- **Hash layers' gate has no bias on disk**: the adapter reads `num_hash_layers` from the checkpoint's `config.json` and drops the corresponding bias keys before DCP load.
- **Indexer / Compressor key flattening**: on disk the Indexer sits as a sibling of the Compressor with its own nested compressor (`indexer.compressor.{ape,norm,wgate,wkv}` + `indexer.{wq_b,weights_proj}`); the adapter renames these to land at the flat `compressor.indexer.*` layout.

A new in-tree `HuggingFaceStorageReader` recognizes `F8_E8M0` and `F8_E5M2` dtypes (the upstream reader silently dropped them), restoring DCP metadata on every rank for these checkpoints.

## Launch Training

A ready-to-use recipe ships at [`examples/llm_finetune/deepseek_v4/deepseek_v4_flash_hellaswag.yaml`](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Automodel/blob/main/examples/llm_finetune/deepseek_v4/deepseek_v4_flash_hellaswag.yaml). The yaml header documents how to scale `num_hidden_layers` and `ep_size` for the full 43-layer multi-node run.

NeMo Automodel supports several ways to launch training — via the Automodel CLI with Slurm, interactive sessions, `torchrun`, and more. For full details on all launch options (Slurm batch jobs, multi-node configuration, environment variables, etc.), see the [Run on a Cluster](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Automodel/blob/main/docs/launcher/slurm.mdx) guide.

### Standalone Slurm Script

Below is a standalone Slurm script example for the HellaSwag recipe. Before running it, ensure your cluster environment is configured following the [Run on a Cluster](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Automodel/blob/main/docs/launcher/slurm.mdx) guide. Then submit the job:

```bash
export TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1
export HF_HOME=your/path/to/hf_cache
export HF_DATASETS_OFFLINE=1
export WANDB_API_KEY=your_wandb_key

srun --output=output.out \
     --error=output.err \
     --container-image /your/path/to/automodel.image.sqsh --no-container-mount-home bash -c "
  CUDA_DEVICE_MAX_CONNECTIONS=1 automodel \
  examples/llm_finetune/deepseek_v4/deepseek_v4_flash_hellaswag.yaml \
  --nproc-per-node=8 \
  --model.config.pretrained_model_name_or_path=/your/local/dsv4-flash \
  --model.config.name_or_path=/your/local/dsv4-flash "
```

**Before you start**:
- Hugging Face applies rate limits on downloads. We recommend cloning the model repository to your local filesystem beforehand.
- Ensure your Hugging Face cache (`HF_HOME`) is configured and that the dataset is already cached locally.
- To enable Weights & Biases logging, set your `WANDB_API_KEY` and configure the `wandb` section in the YAML file.
- For the full 43-layer schedule, increase `ep_size` (and add `pp_size`) per the cluster you are running on; see the yaml header for guidance.

## Layer-Parity Validation

The bringup was validated against the official DeepSeek inference reference (`dsv4flash/inference/model.py`) by per-tensor dump bisection. On the 4-layer parity harness (`compress_ratios=[0, 0, 4, 128]`, `num_hash_layers=2`, PP=1, EP=8):

- **Final-logits cosine similarity: 0.998 vs reference, top-1 token matches.**
- Every block cosine similarity ≥ 0.987.
